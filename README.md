# URL Builder

Using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, create a simple tool which takes three inputs and generates a URL.

## Sample Input
* Original URL: http://google.com
* Source: PSV
* Team: info@progate.com

## Sample Output
http://google.com#src=PSV&team=info@progate.com

## Required Features
* 'Generated URL' is automatically created/updated as user enters the parameters
* Create UI similar to this mockup:
